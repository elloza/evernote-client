- [ ] A toolbar button for sorting the list by the title of the note.
- [ ] A floating button to create new notes. For creating notes will be 2 options:

## References and Notes

* The initial structure of the application will be generated with AndroidStarters application. The template followed is [MVP Android Starterts](). If the application grows, it could be interesting to add interactors.

* The Evernote SDK is very coupled to the Android Framework and in the Demo Sample the Authors uses a proper library called Android Tasks. I will try to isolate their client and use RXJava for execute async operations.

* The login in the Evernote platform will be implemented with the Sandbox account. For test this application please register first: [Evernote SandBox](https://sandbox.evernote.com/Registration.action)

* The Handwritten note is performed drawing in a custom view integrated with this library: [FreeDrawView](https://github.com/RiccardoMoro/FreeDrawView)

* The OCR library used in this application is [tess-two](https://github.com/rmtheis/tess-two). Good tutorial: (Tutorial)[]

* The results obtained with the OCR will be very poor. For developing a great OCR it will be necessary configure language and even train the OCR with the handwrite of the user.
